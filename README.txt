For compatibility with Drupal.org's git repository, this module has no master branch.

Instead, choose the latest available branch compatible with your version of Drupal.

For example, use branch 7.x-1.x for Drupal 7.x.  The 1.x is the version of this module, while the 7.x is the version of Drupal with which the module is compatible.
